BeerJS: Vinnytsia, Ukraine
============

BeerJS: Vinnytsia is for devs to get together, throw a few back, and learn collectively about JavaScript. We value good beer and good code and encourage the sharing of both.

Topics so far have been around JavaScript, but in reality the scope is pretty open. We start the metup by just hanging out and chatting then we will get into presentations. Anyone can present for any amount of time.


Want to hang out?
-----------------

We usually meet on the end of each month.

Click the watch button for this repo to get notified of upcoming meeting dates or date and location changes.


Want to share something?
-----------------------

You can show something you built, talk about something you would like to build, challenge "best" practices, or change the world; your call. Please let me know if you are interested so we don't double up.

Also feel free to come with problems and questions about your code, my code, or whatever.

Comment on the current meetings issue to formally request time or a topic.


Want to bring beer?
------------------

Of course you do.  Those with beer will be given priority seating ;)  Drinking beer is not required to participate though.


The Community
-------------

Community is the reason why we do what we do.  We highly value growing together and here are some places where you can do just that.  We can share relevant and cool content, questions, and start discussions... you get the idea.
